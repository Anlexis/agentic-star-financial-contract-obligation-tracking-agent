"""deploy/invoke_payload.json must work when POSTed, not merely match the suite.

`deploy-stg` posts this file to src/api/server.py, which forwards `input` as the request line
and `input_context` as the structured channel in the same call. Both are populated now -- the
request line carries the record as JSON so that a chat user, who has no structured channel,
reaches the same review through the adapter hook. Nothing exercised that combination, and
deploy-stg would have been the first place it ran.

Success alone is not the bar: the answer must carry the record's own facts and must not carry
the redaction sentinel. An answer that succeeds while printing "[MASKED]" as recorded fact is
the defect, not the fix.
