"""The advisory review must judge the answer against the unmasked record.

The framework's S-2 input gate masks PII shapes in `user_input` before any node runs. The
report is built from `input_context`, which is not masked. Handing the advisory `user_input`
made it compare a correct report against a redacted request and call the report's own values
unsupported -- which is what the platform run showed.
